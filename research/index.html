	<ul>My research focuses on applications of meteorology and climate in the energy sector.
		Specifically, I model the power production of renewable sources, including hydropower, wind and solar (photovoltaic) power,
		to analyse how they vary depending on weather conditions.
		I identified a delay (lag) in response of hydropower production to the precipitation [4],
		and the links between some critical synoptic weather conditions and very low production in wind and photovoltaic power simultaneously [1].
		These insights are useful when the weather-dependency characteristic of the energy system increases with increasing share of renewable sources to mitigate climate change.
