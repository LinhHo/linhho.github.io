	<h1>Hi there, I'm Linh Ho!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Geophysics and Meteorology, University of Cologne, Germany. My research area is applying meteorological data into renewable energy understandings. I'm currently working on how large-scale weather systems can affect the production of wind and solar power.
