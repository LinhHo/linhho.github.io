		<p>My name is Linh, I'm from Vietnam. I'm a researcher in energy meteorology.
			My research interest is how to apply the knowledge about weather and climate to improve the efficiency of an energy system with a high share up to 100% of renewable energy.
			My research skills include modelling hydropower, wind and solar (photovoltaic) power production using meteorological variables, and analyse how their power production can vary depending on weather conditions.
			I did my PhD in meteorology at University of Cologne (Germany). For more information see the Research tab.
		<p>Beside doing research, I also like to write about things I observe and find interesting. You can read some of the writings in the Blogs tab.
